## A motivating example 

Let's start with an example of a function who's derivative we might want to take. Lets say we have a function of two variables \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\). let's say we want to take the derivative of this function with respect to (w.r.t) \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\). Let's define this function \\(y\\) as follows 

\\[ y = [sin(x_1/x_2) + x_1/x_2 - exp(x_2)] \times [x_1/x_2 - exp(x_2)] \\]
